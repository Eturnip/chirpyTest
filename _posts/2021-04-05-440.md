<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">Added a few <a href="../story-0121.html" target="_blank">more pages</a>. I thought this one was only going to be about 5 pages, but I blew past that and I'm only about half done. So probably closer to 15 or 20 pages when it's all done. Not super short, but regular short story length. I'm getting better at predicting how long a story will be but I'm not good at it yet.&nbsp;</div>
