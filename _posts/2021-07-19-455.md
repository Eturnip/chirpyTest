This is the sort of thing that might typically be done before any game assets get made or early in development. Since I am the one doing all the work on this game at the moment I&rsquo;ll do it in whatever order I damn well please. In this case that means I have set up a sort of feedback loop. The stuff I do in the game informs the paintings and vice versa. It&rsquo;s a nonlinear workflow.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>One thing that is absolutely linear for me though, I can&rsquo;t paint without first doing a sketch. Usually many sketches. So here is a set of sketches that I will be turning into a painting.
