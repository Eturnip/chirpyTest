				<div class="paragraph"><span><span>I&rsquo;m working on a small test project with Godot. The last, and only, time that I did anything significant with Godot was a game jam back in 2019. Safe to say that it&rsquo;s been a while. Also, safe to say that Godot has changed a lot in that time.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I&rsquo;m only at the very beginnings of figuring out how the engine works, and I&rsquo;m pretty certain I didn&rsquo;t understand it back when I made a whole game jam project with it. On one hand, I miss some of the nifty tools and add-ons for Unity. On the other hand, I really like how uncluttered and simple it is. Where Unity has some pretty prescribed ways of working, Godot is a bit more &ldquo;*shrug* how do you want to do it&rdquo;. There are a lot of ways to achieve the same goal, but a handful of them are sort of built for you. Maybe. To translate it into terms that only my old 3d modeller brain will understand, it&rsquo;s more like Maya 1.0 and less like whatever Maya is now. All the parts are there, but some assembly might be required.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>If you haven&rsquo;t been reading any of these, or you don&rsquo;t know me very well, you might not know that &lsquo;some assembly required&rsquo; is pretty much my happy place. I like to put stuff together, and I like to figure out new ways of making things, but I&rsquo;m not about to try to program my own engine or anything.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I will be posting sporadic updates on the progress of this thing. If you recall, a few weeks ago, I posted an image of a CRT filter painting setup. Well, here is what that same (similar) setup looks like running in the Godot engine.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/screenshot-2023-04-03-111443_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/screenshot-2023-04-03-111527_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>
