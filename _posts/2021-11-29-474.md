<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">I'm in the home stretch. Only a couple thousand words until I hit 50000 for NaNoWriMo.<br>I don't know if what I have written can be made into something good, but, right now, it seems likely. There is enough here that I think the final book will be around 100,000-120,000 words... which falls right in line with average book length. I have no intention, or desire, at this point to turn it into a sprawling trilogy or grandiose expanded universe. It's a single, contained story. A modern fantasy, semi-romantic comedy, with some darker real world themes. Mostly though, it's an adventure story. It's meant to be fun. So far I think it is.<br></div>
