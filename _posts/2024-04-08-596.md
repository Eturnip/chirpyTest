<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph"><span>Writing recently has been &hellip; slow.</span><br><span>I think doing the &lsquo;write a story every week for six weeks&rsquo; thing is great for getting a bunch of practice coming up with concepts. It&rsquo;s even great for completing projects, since you pretty much have to complete them to submit them. It does burn you out on writing for a bit though.</span><br><span>I got back rejections for the last of the stories I had out, so for the first time in a while, I don&rsquo;t have anything in a queue at a magazine. I will send them back out, well at least one of them will be going back out, but still, it&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer to not have any out right now.</span><br><span>I know that at least one of my six week stories can probably sell, but I also didn&rsquo;t want to turn around and send any out before I had a chance to really punch them up. I think I have forgotten them enough at this point to be able to edit and revise with a clear head.</span><br><span>And then I have my two - no - three almost finished stories that I need to wrap up and send out. Along with all the flash stories I wrote last year. So there is no shortage of things to write or submit.</span><br><span>I guess it&rsquo;s time to go peruse the markets again.&nbsp;</span><br><br>&#8203;</div>
