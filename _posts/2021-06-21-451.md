This is one of a series of concept paintings that I have been doing for my game. The aim with all of these paintings has been to create a sort of 70&rsquo;s album cover aesthetic. The sort of fantasy art that would have been printed on 12 inch vinyls.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>While I could have tried to just straight up copy the style of someone like Roger Dean, that would never have felt like something that I would actually paint. Instead, I started shifting whatever my own style is in the general direction of 70&rsquo;s fantasy art.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>The last painting I did was fine. I like some elements of it. The figure has some good energy and the palette fits the era, but I just didn&rsquo;t like the painting. That happens. I think I actually like about three paintings from the entire series. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t even like those. I read recently that the reason artists don&rsquo;t like their own art is because it looks like they made it. I can second that. Anything that looks like I made it, I&rsquo;m usually not that interested in.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Just to be absolutely clear, I am not some self flagellating artist. I don&rsquo;t have a perfectionist complex or think that nothing is ever good enough. I&rsquo;m just not that interested in looking at stuff I made, because I remember making it. More than that, I know that I can always do more. It&rsquo;s very easy to see the potential in a thing that I made because I typically have no fear of changing it. If I want to repaint a thing, I repaint it. No big deal. When I look at someone else's art I get to dissect it. I can imagine how it was made and reverse engineer the stroke choices, the techniques, the tricks. That is much more interesting to me.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Since that last painting wasn&rsquo;t really doing it for me, I decided to try again. Usually I like to move on and paint something new since I will probably learn more from painting something new. This time I painted the same subject with a similar composition, but I attempted a bunch of the techniques I have been gathering from 70&rsquo;s album art.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Maybe it&rsquo;s successful, maybe it isn&rsquo;t. That isn&rsquo;t really for me to judge. I mean, I made it. I enjoyed making it. But I did make it, so I don&rsquo;t really find it that interesting. Time to move on to the next one. </span></span><br><span></span><br>&#8203;</div>
