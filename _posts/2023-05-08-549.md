<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph"><span><span>I&rsquo;ve been working on a bunch of shaders recently. Some of them do things to the pixels as they are drawn to the screen and some of them do stuff to the geometry before the pixels get drawn to the screen. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, the result is the same. There is some input information, a program beats that up a little, and then it draws the result.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I&rsquo;ve said before, here and elsewhere, that I&rsquo;m a pretty mediocre programmer. I&rsquo;m very good at organizing procedures. Planning out all the steps it will take to go from, say, input pixels to output results. The job of creating digital art, be it 3D, 2D, animated, or some mix of all of them, is 99% that. Creating a pipeline from input to result. It&rsquo;s a lot less &ldquo;feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; based than most people would think. There are practiced steps that get the work from start to whatever anyone wants to call finished.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>So maybe what I mean when I say &lsquo;mediocre programmer&rsquo; is that I program like an artist.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I&rsquo;m going to go back to these shaders. I almost have one of them modifying some pixels in just the way I want.</span></span><br><span></span><br>&#8203;</div>
