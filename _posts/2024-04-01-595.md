				<div class="paragraph"><span>If you have read many of these posts, you know that this place has always been about video game ephemera, from actual development talk to musings on old titles. More recently these posts have also been about fiction writing and everything that goes along with it.</span><br><span></span><span>Well that ends today.</span><br><span></span><span>Unbeknownst to you, and even me, I have spent the last decade writing a collection of the filthiest limericks ever conceived. Each one more grotesquely bawdy than the last. All of this work was conducted while in a deep, near comatose, sleep, and hidden below the foundation of my home.</span><br><span></span><span>I believe that, in some self preserving subconscious place, I knew that these verses were not meant for waking eyes. But I have unearthed them, and I have read them, and I must unburden myself of them.</span><br><span></span><span>Every week from here on out, I will release a single line from one of these foul poems. The first line of the first limerick is at the bottom of this page. With that, this place will forever become a marathon of horror, and for that I am sorry.</span><br><span></span><br><br><span></span><span>There once was a man from Regina -&nbsp;<br>&#8203;</span><br><br><span></span></div>
