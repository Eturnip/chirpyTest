<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">I'm gonna try to write a novel. Probably a bad one. I definitely won't be doing any editing. It won't be polished. It might not make sense. I'm gonna try anyway.<br>I have side-eyed NaNoWriMo (as well as Inktober, and other creative jam type events) for years. I have participated in several Game Jams (create a game in a few days alone or with a team). I have usually found the experience to be sort of rejuvenating. Packing that much effort into a short space of time can be exhausting, but I usually come out with way more ideas and energy than I went in with. At least after a good nights sleep.<br>NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month. Over the course of November, people from all over try to write 50000 words. A novel.<br>There is no rule or guideline on content, genre, or quality. It's just about getting the words out.&nbsp;<br>I will try it. Hopefully I can type enough to reach 50000 words. I have absolutely no ide what I will write. It's an absolutely terrifying prospect.&nbsp;<br>&#8203;I hope it's fun.&nbsp;<br></div>
