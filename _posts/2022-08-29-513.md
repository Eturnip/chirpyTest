<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph"><span><span>Just a short writing update today. I have three short stories in various stages, one in the early edit and rewrite stage, one extremely early with only a concept and outline jotted down, and one that has been reworked so many times I&rsquo;m not sure if it will ever get finished.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I have four stories submitted to a few magazines, but it could be literal months before I get a response back from any of them.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>I also did a little more work on the draft of the novel I started during National Novel Writing Month. That will still take a while before it&rsquo;s ready for major edits, but still, some movement is good.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>And that&rsquo;s writing. It&rsquo;s slow. It&rsquo;s mostly rejection. But I keep doing it, so there&rsquo;s that.</span></span><br><span></span></div>
