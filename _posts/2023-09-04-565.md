				<div class="paragraph"><span>I put up an image a few weeks ago. It was a screen capture of a game I have been working on for a little bit.</span><br><span>Here it is again.</span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/screenshot-2023-08-01-155252_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph"><span>That shot was from the old version of the game.</span><br><span>This one is from the new version.</span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/screenshot-2023-09-04-174732_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph"><span><span>I can imagine that most people won&rsquo;t see much difference between the two. Sure, the background is different, and the character looks a little different, the second one isn't so horrifically zoomed in, but other than that it probably doesn&rsquo;t look like much has changed.</span></span><br><span><span>The first image is entirely 2D. The images are sprites layered one on top of the other. The second image is a blend of 2D textures and 3D models.</span></span><br><span><span>Getting to this point hasn&rsquo;t been easy, and I can guess that some folks might not understand why I made the change in the first place.</span></span><br><span><span>I have spent a lot of years learning how to create art and animation in 3D and I know there are a few things that I can get away with if I work in 3D. The only problem here is I want this game to have a certain 2D retro look. So that means making 3D look like 2D.</span></span><br><span><span>While that might generally be considered more difficult than just working in 2D from the start, I decided that the benefits were worth it.</span></span><br><span><span>My hope is that this game looks weird. That people who play it won&rsquo;t be able to decide what is going on with it. Is it an old 2D arcade game? Is it a modern 3D game?</span></span><br><span><span>If I do everything right, it will be both, and neither. With a bit of luck, it will look interesting.</span></span><br><br>&#8203;</div>
