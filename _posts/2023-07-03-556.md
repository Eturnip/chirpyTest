The cooldown period could last anywhere from a few days to a week or so. Just enough time for me to not feel so close to it, but short enough that I haven&rsquo;t forgotten how I want it to feel.</span><br><span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">It&rsquo;s a luxury, I know. This idea of a cooldown period. Some people are writing at a breakneck pace, or writing to hit deadlines. I can afford a cooldown, and I hope that most other writers are able to find a way to fit such a thing into their schedule.</span><br><span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I won&rsquo;t be writing for a week. I will just move on to one of the other stories that I&rsquo;ve been working on. I&rsquo;ll just push that one to one side for a short while before I look it over again.</span><br><span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">The hope is that when I read it over I don&rsquo;t find too many glaring errors or deficiencies. There will likely be a few lines that get tweaked. Maybe some slight rewording here and there. After that, I will send it out into the world where it can gather a few rejections. Currently, I think it&rsquo;s a fairly good story. Something with some sci-fi ideas, but a core of humanity. A story that will speak to at least some audiences out there. A story that says something to me, at the very least. It&rsquo;s something I hope to ultimately sell to one of the major sci-fi outlets. We&rsquo;ll see what I think of it in a week.</span><br><span></span></div>
