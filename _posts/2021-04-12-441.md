<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">A full first draft of the new story is up <a href="../story-0121.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Like all first drafts it's a little janky in places and will have errors, typos, and plain busted stuff all up in there. If you read it and have suggestions on how to correct that jank, please let me know. I'll probably give it a couple weeks to breath and then revisit the story to punch it up. I have another one that I am in the process of punching up, so I'll probably do that first. In any case, if you read it, I hope you enjoy it.&nbsp;</div>
